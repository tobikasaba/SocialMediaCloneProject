Difference between user__username__iexact and username__iexact:
username__iexact: Directly filters the model (User) with the username field (e.g., User).
user__username__iexact: Filters a model (e.g., Post) based on the username of its related User model.

Use user__username__iexact when you want to reference a related model (User) through a ForeignKey. 
Use username__iexact when you're working with the model that directly has the username field.

**The user in user__username__iexact represents the field name for the ForeignKey in the Post model,
and by referencing it, you are querying the related model (the inbuilt User model in this case)
which has an inbuilt username field

    The SelectRelatedMixin is a mixin used in Django to optimise database queries when retrieving objects that have
    related fields.

    to reduce the number of database queries for related models.

    select_related: Allows Django to fetch related objects in a single query using an SQL JOIN.
    This greatly improves performance for queries involving related models.
