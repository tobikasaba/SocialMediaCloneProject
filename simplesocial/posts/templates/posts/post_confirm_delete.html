        The "object" variable represents the model instance passed from the parent view 'DeletePost'.
        Since the '_post.html' template is not directly tied to a specific view in views.py,
        we explicitly specify "post=object" to tell Django what "post" refers to in the included template.
        This ensures the '_post.html' template has access to the correct data when rendering.

        DeleteView does not automatically pass post as the context variable. By default, Django uses the object
        variable name for the model instance in generic views like DetailView, DeleteView, UpdateView, etc.

        In the case of a DeleteView, Django automatically provides the model instance as object in the template context
        If you want to refer to it as post in your template (which might be more appropriate for a blog post),
        you need to explicitly pass it using the {% include %} tag or use object directly in the template.
